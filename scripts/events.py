        obspy_trace_stats holds metadata common to both miniSEED and SAC formats.
        obspy_trace_stats.sac holds extra metadata only found in the SAC format.

        Floats are NOT converted to np.float32() in either case.

        NB: the SAC header value shown to the world (e.g., "sac.delta"), and the private SAC header
        written to disk (e.g., "sac._hf[0]"), differ in type.  The relevant float header values that
        actually get written to disk with sac.write are stored in the private "._hf" attribute,
        which is not generated with initialization of the raw Stats() container. Therefore, if
        printing those values to, e.g. a text file, ensure the relevant F (float) fields are cast to
        np.float32 first.

        For example:
        >> from obspy.core.trace import Trace
        >> from obspy.io.sac.sactrace import SACTrace
        >> trace = Trace()
        >> sac = SACTrace.from_obspy_trace(trace)  <-- this gets called by sac.write (within stream.write)
        >> sac.delta = 1/20
        >> isinstance(sac.delta, float)            <-- True: this is the public attr shown to the world
        >> isinstance(sac.delta, np.float32)       <-- False
        >> isinstance(sac._hf[0], float)           <-- False
        >> isinstance(sac._hf[0], np.float32)      <-- True: this is the private attr written to disk
