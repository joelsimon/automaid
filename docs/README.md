# automaid documentation

Short reference pages for data access and output formats. Each topic has its
own page so that updates stay focused.

`automaid` processes raw MERMAID instrument files from the configured `server`
directory and writes derived products to the configured `processed` directory.
Its outputs include seismic data products, plots, and metadata. These Argo
pages are reference material; automaid does not currently produce standard
Argo profile files.

- [Where Argo files go](CTD_data_centers.md): authoritative archives and discovery tools.
- [What the file formats are](CTD_file_formats.md): Argo profile formats and automaid's current SAL/TEMP-related outputs.
- [Argo pathway goals](CTD_argo_goals.md): near-term example-shaped NetCDF and long-term archive pathway.
- [Near-term NetCDF checklist](CTD_netcdf_checklist.md): tasks for the pseudo-compliant prototype.

These pages summarize external standards and current code behavior. They do not
make automaid an Argo DAC, GDAC, or format-compliant producer.
